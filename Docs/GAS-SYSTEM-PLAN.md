# Gas System — Qud-parity port plan

> **Status:** G.1 (this commit). Plan-only.
> **Branch:** `feat/gas-system`
> **Source survey:** `Docs/QUD-GAS-INVESTIGATION.md` (the post-LA-followup
> investigation report — read that first).

## 0. The question, answered

Caves of Qud's gas system is a parallel to its liquid system: per-cell
entities (`Gas` Part) plus behavior Parts (`IGasBehavior` subtypes) that
dispatch effects on creatures/objects in the same cell. CoO already has
the matching half for liquids (`LiquidPoolPart` + `LiquidCoveredEffect`).
Gas is the missing half. This plan ports it with full Qud parity where
the engine supports it.

## 1. Reference — how Qud actually does it (verification sweep)

| Premise | Confirmed at | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Gas is a Part on a GameObject that lives in a Cell | `qud/XRL.World.Parts/Gas.cs:1-422` | One GameObject per gas cloud, freely created/destroyed |
| Density + Level + Seeping + Stable + GasType + ColorString + Creator are the universal state | `Gas.cs:12-27` | Five ints/bools + two strings + one entity ref |
| ProcessGasBehavior runs each turn-tick — decay + wind-biased random walk + dissipation | `Gas.cs:162-318` | The dispersal heart |
| Merge is GasType + ColorString matched | `Gas.cs:354-410` | Merge or partial merge (MergeToGas) |
| `IGasBehavior` accessor caches the sibling `Gas` Part | `IGasBehavior.cs:5-21` | Abstract base; provides BaseGas + GasDensityStepped |
| `IObjectGasBehavior` iterates cell.Objects and calls ApplyGas(obj) on each | `IObjectGasBehavior.cs:34-79` | Concrete dispatch loop; OnTurnTick + ObjectEnteredCellEvent |
| `CheckGasCanAffectEvent.Check` is the blanket veto layer | `CheckGasCanAffectEvent.cs:34-46` | Listened by `GasImmunity` |
| `GasMask.HandleEvent(GetRespiratoryAgentPerformanceEvent)` reduces gas intake by Power*5 | `GasMask.cs:29-36` | Defensive equipment |
| Wind = `Zone.CurrentWindSpeed/Direction` gated by `GlobalConfig.GetBoolSetting("WindAffectsGasDispersal")` | `Gas.cs:214-218` | Wind biases dispersal direction + frequency |
| `Object.Respires` is a hard gate for breathe-gas dispatch | `GasPoison.cs:100` | Robots/undead skip the entire pipeline |
| GasCryo bypasses Respires and hits all matter via TemperatureChange + cold damage | `GasCryo.cs:127-145` | Different parent class (IGasBehavior, not IObjectGasBehavior) |
| GasPlasma applies `CoatedInPlasma` Effect for `Random(density*2/5, density*3/5)` ticks | `GasPlasma.cs:104-123` | Gas-as-coat hybrid (Effect outlasts the cloud) |
| `BurnOffGas` spawns gas blueprint on Heat/Fire damage threshold | `BurnOffGas.cs:74-117` | Outgassing-on-fire (burn fungi → spores) |
| `EmitGasOnHit` rolls density on impact cell + adjacent on weapon hit | `EmitGasOnHit.cs:132-188` | Gas-emitting weapons |
| `GasGrenade.DoDetonate` spawns 9 gas clouds in a 3×3 square | `GasGrenade.cs:56-86` | Throwable gas item |
| AI nav weight: `Smart` AI sees `density/2 + level*10` capped at 80; non-Smart flat 8 | `GasPoison.cs:38-55` | Pathfinding integration |
| Per-creature filter chain: Respires → Creature tag → CheckGasCanAffectEvent → CanApply{Specific}Gas → CanApplyEffectEvent → PhaseMatches → GetRespiratoryAgentPerformanceEvent | `GasPoison.cs:77-124` | 7-layer veto/modifier pipeline |

## 2. What CoO already has (the substrate we build on)

| CoO piece | What it gives us | File |
|---|---|---|
| `LiquidPoolPart` | Pattern: per-cell entity with `RenderPart` + `PhysicsPart{Solid=false}` + payload Part | `Materials/LiquidPoolPart.cs:35-163` |
| `LiquidRegistry` (Initialize / InitializeFromJsonSources / ResetForTests / Get / IsInitialized / Count) | Pattern: JSON-driven content registry with bootstrap wiring | `Materials/LiquidRegistry.cs:19` |
| `LiquidDefinition` | Pattern: flyweight data class with serializable JSON fields | `Materials/LiquidDefinition.cs:21` |
| `TurnManager.TickEnd` event on `World` singleton entity | The per-turn dispatch hook (gas dispersal listens here) | `Turns/TurnManager.cs:371-373` |
| `Effect.OnTurnStart(Entity, GameEvent)` | The status-effect-side tick (gas-applied effects like PoisonedByGas tick here) | `Effects/Effect.cs:185-188` |
| `Entity` + `Part` + event dispatch | The Qud-parity Part architecture | `Core/Entity.cs`, `Core/Part.cs` |
| `Zone.AddEntity / MoveEntity / GetCell / InBounds` | Cell placement + movement for gas spread | `World/Map/Zone.cs:85-234` |
| `Damage.HasAttribute("Gas")` + `Damage` typed object | Gas-damage attribute (Qud uses the same string) | `Combat/Damage.cs:99` |
| `Diag.Record(category, kind, actor, target, payload)` | Per-gate diag observability | `Shared/Utilities/Diag.cs` |
| `SettlementRuntime.ActiveZone` | Static zone accessor for systems that don't get one passed | `Settlements/SettlementRuntime.cs:7` |
| `GameBootstrap` Step 1b' pattern | Where to add `GasRegistry` initialization | `Bootstrap/GameBootstrap.cs:116-134` |

**What CoO is missing** (out of scope for this ship; deferred):
- Wind concept (`Zone.CurrentWindSpeed/Direction`) — defer to G.10
- Phase matching (`GameObject.PhaseMatches`) — defer or skip
- `GetMatterPhaseEvent` — skip (no caller in CoO needs it yet)
- `Object.Respires` predicate — add as a Tag check (`Tags["Respires"]`) instead of a property
- AI pathfinding nav-weight events — CoO has `AI*Part` system; the integration is its own milestone (G.11)

## 3. Architecture decisions (Qud → CoO mapping)

### 3.1 Class hierarchy (mirrors Qud)

```
Part (CoO base)
├── GasPoolPart                  // universal: Density/Level/Seeping/Stable/GasType/Color/Creator
│                                // dispersal+merge+dissipation engine (G.3-G.4)
└── IGasBehaviorPart (abstract)  // BaseGas accessor + GasDensityStepped()
    └── IObjectGasBehaviorPart (abstract)
        │                        // iterates cell entities, calls ApplyGas(entity)
        │                        // listens to EntityEnteredCell + TickEnd
        ├── GasPoisonPart        // G.5 — Respires-gated, applies PoisonedByGasEffect + tick damage
        ├── GasStunPart          // G.8 — applies StunnedEffect (existing)
        ├── GasSleepPart         // G.8 — applies AsleepEffect (new) or SleepingEffect (existing?)
        ├── GasConfusionPart     // G.8 — applies ConfusedEffect (existing — verify)
        ├── GasFungalSporesPart  // G.8 — applies SporeInfectionEffect (new)
        └── GasPlasmaPart        // G.8 — applies CoatedInPlasmaEffect (new, gas-as-coat hybrid)
    └── GasCryoPart              // G.8 — direct IGasBehavior child; hits all matter via cold damage
                                 // (mirrors Qud's "no Respires gate" design)
```

### 3.2 JSON content (mirrors LiquidDefinition / LiquidRegistry)

`Resources/Content/Data/GasDefinitions/<id>.json`:

```json
{
  "Gases": [
    {
      "Id": "poison-vapor",
      "DisplayName": "poison vapor",
      "Adjective": "poison-fumed",
      "GasType": "Poison",
      "Glyph": "°",
      "Color": "&g",
      "DefaultDensity": 100,
      "DefaultLevel": 1,
      "Seeping": false,
      "Stable": false,
      "BehaviorKind": "Poison"
    }
  ]
}
```

`GasRegistry` mirrors `LiquidRegistry` exactly (Initialize / InitializeFromJsonSources / ResetForTests / Get / IsInitialized / Count). Bootstrap pulls every `.json` in `Resources/Content/Data/GasDefinitions/` at startup.

### 3.3 Spawning a gas cloud

A gas cloud is an `Entity` with three Parts:
- `RenderPart { RenderString=def.Glyph, ColorString=def.Color, DisplayName=def.DisplayName }`
- `PhysicsPart { Solid=false }` (creatures walk through gas)
- `GasPoolPart { GasId, Density, Level, Seeping, Stable, GasType, ColorString, Creator }`
- Optional sibling behavior Part (e.g. `GasPoisonPart`) — added in G.5+

Authoring: a static helper `GasFactory.SpawnGas(Zone, x, y, gasId, density, level, creator)` creates the entity, applies the def's render, attaches the behavior Part for the def's `BehaviorKind`, places at (x, y). (Equivalent of `GameObject.Create("PoisonGas")` in Qud.)

### 3.4 Dispersal loop dispatch (G.3)

Two options for "who calls ProcessGasBehavior each turn":

- **(A) Each gas pool subscribes to TickEnd** — gas pool's `Initialize()` registers a `TickEnd` listener on `TurnManager.World`. Each gas listens for itself.
- **(B) A `GasSystem` static class iterates all gas pools each turn** — TurnManager fires TickEnd → GasSystem.OnTickEnd walks `ActiveZone.GetAllEntities()`, finds GasPoolParts, runs dispersal.

**Recommendation: (B)**, mirrors how Qud's `XRLCore` walks `WantTurnTick()` objects. Cleaner; one place to add diag, profiling, ordering rules. CoO doesn't have `WantTurnTick` but `SettlementRuntime.ActiveZone.GetAllEntities()` is the analog.

### 3.5 Merge semantics (G.4)

Two gases share a cell only if they don't merge (incompatible GasType). When a gas spreads into a cell containing a compatible gas:
- **Full merge** (when a spreader of equal/greater density meets a sibling): receiver += donor.Density, MaxLevel wins, OR-merge Seeping, inherit Creator if missing. Donor dies.
- **Partial merge** (when spreading a chunk): receiver += chunk, donor -= chunk.

`GasPoolPart.OnStack`-equivalent: there's no native CoO `OnStack` for entities (that's an Effect concept). The merge happens **inside the dispersal loop** when looking at the destination cell's existing gases.

### 3.6 Per-creature filter pipeline (G.5)

The CoO equivalent of Qud's 7-layer pipeline:

| Qud layer | CoO equivalent (G.5) |
|---|---|
| `Object != self` | reference check |
| `Object.Respires` | `Tags.ContainsKey("Respires")` — added to creature blueprints |
| `Object.HasTag("Creature")` | `Tags.ContainsKey("Creature")` — existing |
| `CheckGasCanAffectEvent.Check` | New `CheckGasCanAffect` event fired on the target; `GasImmunityPart` handles + vetoes |
| `Object.FireEvent("CanApply{Specific}GasGas")` | per-effect veto event — fire on target before ApplyEffect |
| `CanApplyEffectEvent.Check<T>` | CoO has `target.CanApplyEffect<T>()` if a check exists; else inline |
| `PhaseMatches` | skip (out of scope) |
| `GetRespiratoryAgentPerformanceEvent` | New `GetRespiratoryPerformance` event; `GasMaskPart` reduces intake |
| Apply effect + immediate damage | `target.ApplyEffect(...)` + `CombatSystem.ApplyDamage(...)` |

### 3.7 Events (new)

| Event | Direction | When |
|---|---|---|
| `TickEnd` | listened by `GasSystem` | once per turn |
| `EntityEnteredCell` | listened by `GasPoolPart` | a mover stepped into the gas's cell |
| `CheckGasCanAffect` | fired by gas behavior, vetoed by `GasImmunityPart` | before applying any gas effect |
| `GetRespiratoryPerformance` | fired by gas behavior, reduced by `GasMaskPart` | after CheckGasCanAffect, before apply |
| `CreatorModifyGas` | fired by gas behavior, listened by source's equipment | spawning a gas (lets GasTumbler amplify density) |
| `CreatorModifyGasDispersal` | fired by gas-pool dispersal, listened by source's equipment | per dispersal tick (lets GasTumbler slow decay) |
| `DensityChange` | fired by `GasPoolPart` when Density changes | every density mutation |
| `GasSpawned` | fired on new gas | on dispersal-spread |

## 4. Sub-milestones (smallest blast radius first)

### G.1 — This plan + branch (this commit)

Doc-only. `Docs/GAS-SYSTEM-PLAN.md`. Branch `feat/gas-system` from main.

### G.2 — Foundation (the next commit — this PR's "Phase 1")

The smallest viable slice: a gas pool entity that EXISTS in a cell with
correct render/state, but doesn't yet disperse, merge, or apply effects.

**New files:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasDefinition.cs` — `[Serializable]` data class. Fields: Id, DisplayName, Adjective, GasType, Glyph, Color, DefaultDensity, DefaultLevel, Seeping, Stable, BehaviorKind.
- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasRegistry.cs` — mirror of LiquidRegistry (Initialize / InitializeFromJsonSources / ResetForTests / Get / IsInitialized / Count).
- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasPoolPart.cs` — universal Gas Part. Fields: GasId, Density, Level, Seeping, Stable, GasType, ColorString, Creator. `Initialize()` applies def.Glyph/Color to the entity's RenderPart (mirror of LiquidPoolPart.ApplyDefinitionRender). Density setter fires "DensityChange" event. NO dispersal yet (G.3). NO behavior yet (G.5+).
- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasFactory.cs` — static helper `SpawnGas(Zone, x, y, gasId, density, level, creator)` — creates the entity with the standard 3 Parts + def-driven render. Returns the spawned entity (null on bad inputs).
- `Assets/Resources/Content/Data/GasDefinitions/poison-vapor.json` — first content row (no behavior wired yet — visual + state placeholder).
- `Assets/Tests/EditMode/Gameplay/Materials/GasPoolPartTests.cs` — content + behavior + counter + diag tests.

**Modified files:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Presentation/Bootstrap/GameBootstrap.cs` — add Step 1b'' (GasRegistry init) mirroring 1b' (LiquidRegistry).

**Test coverage (RED → GREEN):**
- Content: `poison-vapor.json` parses + registers with GasType="Poison", default density 100
- Behavior: `GasFactory.SpawnGas` creates an entity with all 3 Parts, def.Glyph/Color applied to RenderPart
- Counter: SpawnGas with unknown gasId returns null (no crash, no half-built entity)
- State: GasPoolPart.Density round-trips through save (public field, mirrors LiquidPoolPart.Volume)
- Diag: every spawn emits `gas/Created` with payload (gasId, density, level, x, y)
- Density setter: setting `pool.Density = 50` fires "DensityChange" event with OldValue/NewValue params

**Observability (CoO §Observability rule):**
- `gas/Created` — new gas entity spawned in a cell
- `gas/DensityChange` — density mutated (already gated to fire only when actually changes)

**No dispersal, merge, behavior, defense, or production yet.**

### G.3 — Dispersal mechanic (one commit)

`GasSystem` static class with `OnTickEnd(World, GameEvent)` listener. On each tick, iterate `SettlementRuntime.ActiveZone.GetAllEntities()`, find GasPoolParts, call `ProcessGasBehavior(zone)`. The `ProcessGasBehavior` body is a port of `Gas.cs:204-319` — decay if unstable, random-walk spread, dissipation. No wind yet (defer to G.10). New diag: `gas/Dispersed`, `gas/Dissipated`, `gas/Spread`.

### G.4 — Merge semantics (one commit)

`GasSystem.SpreadToCell` checks the destination for compatible gas (same GasType + ColorString); if present, calls `GasPoolPart.MergeFrom(other, chunk)`; if absent, spawns a new gas via GasFactory. The Creator inheritance + Seeping OR + Level max rules from Qud. Counter: incompatible gases don't merge (different GasType in same cell coexists). Diag: `gas/Merged`.

### G.5 — First behaving gas: poison (one commit)

`IGasBehaviorPart` abstract + `IObjectGasBehaviorPart` + `GasPoisonPart` concrete. Per-creature filter pipeline: Respires tag, Creature tag, CheckGasCanAffect event, GetRespiratoryPerformance event, ApplyEffect. New `PoisonedByGasEffect` (Effect class). The poison-vapor.json gets `BehaviorKind="Poison"` and a `GasPoisonPart` attached on spawn. Diag: `gas/Applied`, `gas/Affected`, `gas/ApplyVetoed` (with reason field). Tests: damage tick lands on Creature+Respires; doesn't land on non-Creature; doesn't land on non-Respires; emits diag per gate.

### G.6 — Defenses (one commit)

- `GasMaskPart` (equipment): reduces `GetRespiratoryPerformance.Intake` by `Power * 5`
- `GasImmunityPart` (creature): vetoes `CheckGasCanAffect` when `GasType` matches
- Counter tests: gas-mask-wearing creature takes less damage; gas-immune creature takes none

### G.7 — Production: throwable + on-hit (one commit)

- `GasGrenadePart`: `DoDetonate(Cell)` spawns 9 gases in 3×3
- `EmitGasOnHitPart`: on weapon-hit event, rolls density on impact + adjacent
- One gas-grenade blueprint (`PoisonGasGrenade`) + one EmitGas weapon (`PoisonFangs` snapjaw variant?)

### G.8 — More gas types (one commit per type, or batched)

- `GasCryoPart` (cold damage to all matter via TemperatureChange — needs CoO thermal coupling)
- `GasStunPart` (applies StunnedEffect — exists)
- `GasSleepPart` (applies AsleepEffect — new or existing?)
- `GasConfusionPart` (applies ConfusedEffect — verify exists)
- `GasFungalSporesPart` (applies SporeInfectionEffect — new)
- `GasPlasmaPart` (applies CoatedInPlasmaEffect — new)

### G.9 — Outgassing-on-fire (one commit)

`BurnOffGasPart`: on `BeforeTakeDamage` with Heat/Fire attribute, accumulate damage; on threshold, spawn N copies of `Blueprint` gas at the current cell. Tests: damage threshold + Number roll + Heat-only triggering.

### G.10 — Wind coupling (one commit)

`Zone.CurrentWindSpeed` + `CurrentWindDirection` (new fields, default 0/"."). Plumb into `GasSystem.ProcessGasBehavior` dispersal — bias direction + frequency. New `BlowAwayGasPart` (creature/equipment with Radius that pushes nearby gas away each turn).

### G.11 — AI navigation integration (one commit)

Hook gas avoidance into existing CoO `AIBehaviorPart` / `Goals.MoveToGoal` pathfinding. Density-stepped, gas-immunity-aware. May need a new "nav weight" event analog.

### G.12 — Bench + cold-eye + adversarial sweep + merge (one commit)

`GasDispersalTestBench` scenario — synthetic matrix:
- Spawn 1 gas of each type at known cells
- Tick N turns
- Audit: density decreased? Did it spread? Did it merge? Did it dissipate?
- Spawn a creature with each defense (gas-mask, immunity, none); fire ApplyGas; audit each
- Live diag query with runId scoping (Rule 8)
- Cold-eye Q1–Q4
- Adversarial sweep file (taxonomy: state atomicity, save/load reach, cross-actor flows, boundary inputs, mid-tick death, probability boundaries, etc.)
- Roadmap update; merge to main

## 5. Performance section

Gas pools are per-cell entities. Per-tick cost = O(N_gas) where N_gas is
the count of active gas entities in `ActiveZone`. For dispersal, each
gas does up to 4 cell-spawn attempts → O(4N_gas) worst case per turn.

Pre-flag:
- **Use `Zone.GetAllEntities()` returning a List** — already allocates (Zone.cs:239) but it's a one-shot per-tick, not per-frame
- **GasSystem iterates the gas-pool list ONCE per tick** — mutations during iteration (new gas spawned, old gas dissipated) handled via snapshot-then-iterate pattern
- **DensityChange event** — fires per density mutation; LiquidPoolPart-style listeners (AI nav cache flush) attach here. Skip the event if Density doesn't actually change (event-fired on setter only when oldValue != newValue, mirroring Qud's `_Density != value` gate)
- **Profiler check**: spawn 50 gases, tick 60 turns, measure with `ProfilerRecorder` (mirroring CLAUDE.md §Performance rule 1)

No per-frame or per-render allocations expected. No new MonoBehaviour with Update/LateUpdate. The system runs only on `TickEnd`.

## 6. Observability plan

Every gate emits a `gas/...` record:

| Kind | Fires on | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `gas/Created` | new gas spawned (factory) | gasId, density, level, x, y, creator |
| `gas/DensityChange` | density mutated | gasId, oldDensity, newDensity, delta |
| `gas/Dispersed` | dispersal tick decremented density | gasId, dropped, remaining |
| `gas/Spread` | dispersal spawned/merged in new cell | gasId, fromCell, toCell, chunk |
| `gas/Merged` | two gases combined | gasId, donorDensity, receiverDensityBefore, receiverDensityAfter |
| `gas/Dissipated` | gas removed from cell | gasId, cause |
| `gas/Applied` | effect applied to a target | gasId, target, effectName, level |
| `gas/Affected` | target took damage from gas | gasId, target, damageType, amount |
| `gas/ApplyVetoed` | filter pipeline rejected | gasId, target, reason (one of NullActor / NotACreature / NotRespires / GasImmunity / CanApplyVetoed / CanApplyEffectVetoed / ZeroIntake) |
| `gas/MaskReduced` | GetRespiratoryPerformance reduced intake | gasId, target, baseIntake, reducedIntake, mask |

## 7. Pre-flagged self-review (fix or defer pre-commit)

- **🟡 Wind coupling deferred (G.10).** Qud's `Zone.CurrentWindSpeed/Direction` doesn't exist in CoO. The dispersal in G.3 uses no-wind defaults. Document the deferral; the dispersal API takes optional wind params so G.10 is a JSON-tuning-only change.
- **🟡 Phase matching skipped.** Qud's `PhaseMatches` is the cross-phase visibility gate; CoO doesn't have phase yet and no caller needs it. Document as out-of-scope; if a future "phased gas grenade" item ships, add then.
- **🟡 Respires tag — new tag.** Creatures need `Tags["Respires"]` for the breathe pipeline to fire. The first non-Respires creature in CoO (a robot or undead) doesn't exist yet, so G.5 ships with all creatures defaulting to respiring (gate is `if (Tags.ContainsKey("Respires"))` but a future opt-out is just removing the tag from a blueprint).
- **🔵 GasSystem singleton.** `GasSystem` is static (mirrors `LiquidRegistry` shape). State lives in the gas pool entities, not the system — system is just dispatch.
- **🔵 No Phased/Omniphase effects yet.** Qud's effects that make gas cross phase boundaries are skipped.
- **🔵 AI navigation deferred (G.11).** Creatures don't avoid gas in their pathing until G.11. Early gas content (G.5-G.10) means dumb-creature charges through poison clouds — acceptable for content-bringup.
- **⚪ Outgassing-on-fire (G.9) requires existing damage attribute system to route Heat correctly** — verified during G.9 sweep; same path the existing acid + element coats use.
- **🧪 RED discipline** — content RED via on-disk file load (Initialize), behavior RED before each engine extension is wired. Same pattern as LA/LB.

## 8. Implementation log

> Filled in per phase as commits land.

### G.1
Plan to disk. Branch `feat/gas-system` from main. Commit `8a0e371`.

### G.2 (this commit) — Foundation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE. The minimum viable gas-system slice: per-cell
entity with state + render, factory rejects bad inputs gracefully,
density mutations fire an event. No dispersal yet, no behavior yet.

**Shipped:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasDefinition.cs` — `[Serializable]` data class (Id/DisplayName/Adjective/GasType/Glyph/Color/DefaultDensity/DefaultLevel/Seeping/Stable/BehaviorKind) + `GasDefinitionCollection` JSON wrapper. Mirror of `LiquidDefinition`.
- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasRegistry.cs` — Static registry mirroring `LiquidRegistry` exactly (Initialize / InitializeFromJsonSources / ResetForTests / Get / IsInitialized / Count + malformed-JSON resilience).
- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasPoolPart.cs` — Universal "I am gas" Part. Public fields for save round-trip. `Density` is a property with a setter that clamps to ≥ 0, suppresses zero-delta mutations, and fires `"GasDensityChange"` event with `OldValue`/`NewValue` params (mirroring Qud `Gas.cs:50-55`). `Initialize()` applies def.Glyph/Color to the entity's RenderPart via `ApplyDefinitionRender` (mirror of `LiquidPoolPart`).
- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasFactory.cs` — Static `SpawnGas(zone, x, y, gasId, density=-1, level=-1, creator=null)` returns the spawned `Entity` on success or null on any rejection (4 rejection paths: RegistryUninitialized / UnknownGas / NullZone / CellOutOfBounds). Each rejection emits a `gas/SpawnRejected` diag with reason; success emits `gas/Created`.
- `Assets/Resources/Content/Data/GasDefinitions/poison-vapor.json` — First content row (GasType=Poison, Glyph=°, Color=&g, DefaultDensity=100, no behavior wired yet — `BehaviorKind=""`).
- Bootstrap wiring: `GameBootstrap.cs` Step 1b'' loads `Resources/Content/Data/GasDefinitions/*.json` mirroring Step 1b' (LiquidDefinitions).
- "gas" added to `Diag.DefaultOnCategories` so diag emissions survive.

**Tests (22 total, all GREEN):**
- Registry: uninitialized state, single-JSON init, malformed-JSON resilience, late-row-wins on Id collision
- Content: `poison-vapor.json` parses with expected shape
- SpawnGas rejections (4): RegistryUninitialized, UnknownGas, NullZone, CellOutOfBounds — each emits the right reason
- SpawnGas happy-path: all 3 Parts attached, Render pulled from def, PhysicsPart non-solid, defaults inherited, density/level overrides win, placed at requested cell, Gas tag applied, Creator carried through, Created diag emitted with all payload fields
- Density property: negative clamps to 0, mutation fires event with old/new values, zero-delta is silent (no event), 0→-5 clamps to 0 with no event

**IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (risks verified before writing code)**
1. `LiquidRegistry.cs` is the loader template — copied shape exactly (Initialize / InitializeFromJsonSources / AppendJson / Get / ResetForTests / IsInitialized / Count).
2. `LiquidPoolPart.ApplyDefinitionRender` is the render-pull template — copied shape (null-safe registry/id/render-part checks).
3. `Zone.AddEntity` returns bool; `false` means out-of-bounds or invalid cell. Factory uses this for the CellOutOfBounds rejection path.
4. `Entity.AddPart` is the canonical attach point; tags via `entity.Tags["Gas"] = ""` follows the existing convention.
5. `GameEvent.SetParameter("OldValue", (object)int)` boxes the int for the parameter dictionary — same pattern other density-style events use.
6. `Diag.IsChannelEnabled("gas")` gated on `DefaultOnCategories` — confirmed RED first (5 diag tests failed with `Count: 0`), then GREEN after adding "gas" to the array.

**SCOPE DIVERGENCE FROM THE PLAN — none.**

**G.2 SELF-REVIEW (CLAUDE.md §5)**
- 🟡 (resolved) Diag channel — caught by the first RED run (5 diag-related tests failed with `Count: 0` because the "gas" channel wasn't in `Diag.DefaultOnCategories`). Fix was a 1-line addition. Logged here so future bring-up-of-new-channel work doesn't repeat the gap.
- 🔵 Density setter fires event on `0 → useDensity` at spawn — looks like an accidental event for the spawn delta. Intentional: any listener subscribing to GasDensityChange will see the initial density assignment as "appeared with N density." If that's undesirable, callers can attach the GasPoolPart with `_density = useDensity` directly (bypassing the setter); the factory uses the setter so the spawn IS observable. Tested via `SpawnGas_HappyPath_*` chains.
- 🔵 Render colors not applied through `ColorString` field on `GasPoolPart` — the Part stores `ColorString` for merge identity (G.4) and dispersal-cycle re-render (G.3), while the entity's `RenderPart.ColorString` is what actually renders. Two copies that must stay in sync; documented in the Part's doc-comment. Tested via `SpawnGas_DefaultsCopyFromDef` (pool.ColorString matches def.Color).
- 🧪 RED → GREEN observed — initial run produced 5 RED tests with concrete failure messages (`Expected: 1 But was: 0` on the diag-pin tests). Fixed by adding "gas" to `DefaultOnCategories`; re-ran 22/22 GREEN.
- ⚪ Wind, phase, AI nav — deferred per §7 self-review.

**Tests:** 22 new GREEN. Full regression sweep (10 suites, 275 tests
including all liquid suites + scenario smoke): all green.

### G.3+G.4 (this commit) — Dispersal + Merge

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE. Combined in one commit because the merge logic
fires *during* the spread step, not as a separate pass — splitting
them into separate commits would mean G.3 spawns new gas in every
destination cell (wrong) until G.4 lands. The two are tightly coupled.

**Shipped:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasSystem.cs` — Static dispersal +
  merge engine. Public API: `OnTickEnd(zone)` (entry from TickEnd
  listener), `ProcessGasBehavior(gas, zone)` (per-gas tick),
  `GetDispersalRate(pool)` (with `CreatorModifyGasDispersal` event hook
  for G.7 GasTumbler), `IsMergeCompatible(a, b)` (same GasType + same
  ColorString — Qud parity), `MergeChunk(src, dst, chunk)` (port of Qud
  `MergeToGas`), `Dissipate(gas, pool, zone, cause)`, `SetRngForTests`.
- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasSystemPart.cs` — Singleton Part
  on the World entity. Listens to TickEnd → calls
  `GasSystem.OnTickEnd(SettlementRuntime.ActiveZone)`. Mirrors
  `NarrativeStatePart.cs:62-77` event-routing pattern.
- `Assets/Tests/EditMode/Gameplay/Materials/GasSystemTests.cs` —
  33 tests across 2 sections (unit + integration).

**Modified:**
- `GameBootstrap.cs`: attach `GasSystemPart` to World right after
  `NarrativeStatePart` and `StoryletPart`.
- `GasSystem.Merged` diag record's payload includes `donorType /
  receiverType / donorColor / receiverColor` so the
  `IsMergeCompatible` gate's correctness is observable in diag without
  grep (caught by 2 RED → GREEN cycles during testing).

**Constants ported from Qud (each cites the Qud line):**
| Constant | Value | Qud source |
|---|---|---|
| `BASE_SPREAD_CHANCE` | 25 | `Gas.cs:226` |
| `LOW_DENSITY_THRESHOLD` | 10 | `Gas.cs:313` |
| `LOW_DENSITY_DISSIPATE_CHANCE` | 50 | `Gas.cs:313` |
| `MAX_SPREAD_CHUNK` | 30 | `Gas.cs:273` |
| `MIN_DISPERSAL_RATE` | 1 | `Gas.cs:344` |
| `MAX_DISPERSAL_RATE` | 3 | `Gas.cs:344` |

**Tests (33 total, all GREEN):**

*PART I — Unit (no RNG dependence):*
- `IsMergeCompatible`: same type+color → true; different type → false;
  different color → false; null side → false
- `MergeChunk`: density moves, chunk-larger-than-src clamps,
  negative-chunk no-op, level max wins, level-low doesn't downgrade,
  seeping ORs, seeping-not-lost-counter, creator inherit when null,
  creator preserved when set
- `Dissipate`: removes entity, emits diag with cause
- `GetDispersalRate`: result in [MIN, MAX], CreatorModifyEvent
  amplifies (via stub `GasDispersalRateDoubler` Part)
- `ProcessGasBehavior`: unstable decays, stable+walled doesn't decay,
  zero-density dissipates, null gas / null zone don't crash

*PART II — Integration (seeded `Random(42)`):*
- `OnTickEnd`: null zone, empty zone — no crash
- `OnTickEnd_UnstableGas_EventuallyDissipates` — unstable gas drains
  within 500 ticks (took fewer than 100)
- `OnTickEnd_GasSpreadsToAdjacentCells_OverTime` — high-density gas
  emits ≥1 `gas/Spread` records over 100 ticks
- `OnTickEnd_GasBlockedBySolid_DoesNotSpread` — surround with walls,
  gas count outside the wall ring stays 0 over 30 ticks
- `OnTickEnd_SeepingGas_PassesThroughSolidEventually` — same setup +
  `Seeping=true`, gas escapes within 100 ticks
- `OnTickEnd_TwoIncompatibleGases_NoCrossTypeMerges` — adjacent
  Poison + Cryo: many merges fire (poison-poison and cryo-cryo from
  spread spawns) but NONE cross types — counted by
  `donorType != receiverType` in diag payload
- `OnTickEnd_SameTypeDifferentColor_NoCrossColorMerges` — same shape
  for color identity (Qud parity: color is part of merge key)
- `OnTickEnd_DispersalEmitsDispersedDiag` — one Dispersed per gas per tick
- `OnTickEnd_NewlySpawnedGas_DoesNotProcessSameTick` — snapshot
  iteration safety: spread spawns count for NEXT tick, not this one

**IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (risks verified before writing code)**
1. `NarrativeStatePart.cs:62-77` is the TickEnd-listener template. Copied
   shape (private static int EventID + WantEvent + HandleEvent).
2. `Cell.IsSolid()` (Cell.cs:87-95) checks any object with "Solid" tag —
   the gate for non-seeping spread.
3. `Zone.GetEntitiesWithTag("Gas")` uses the tag index from G.2
   (Zone.cs:259-267) — O(matches), not O(N).
4. Snapshot-iterate pattern: allocate a `List` once per tick. Mid-tick
   spawns are NOT in the snapshot (they'll process next tick).
   Mirrors Qud's `XRLCore` `WantTurnTick` dispatch.
5. `System.Random.Next(int max)` is virtual — `SetRngForTests` swaps
   it cleanly for deterministic-seed tests.

**SCOPE DIVERGENCE FROM THE PLAN — none.**

**G.3+G.4 SELF-REVIEW (CLAUDE.md §5)**
- 🟡 (resolved) Initial test assertions for "no cross-type merges"
  failed because intra-species merges (poison-poison from spread
  spawns) emit Merged records too, and my assertion was "Merged.Count == 0".
  Real RED, fixed by enriching the diag payload with `donorType /
  receiverType / donorColor / receiverColor` and asserting on
  `donorType != receiverType` count instead. The gate itself
  (`IsMergeCompatible`) was correct all along — the test was wrong.
- 🟡 (resolved) Initial spread test counted live entities post-loop;
  but spread spawns are themselves unstable and dissipate before the
  loop ends. Fixed by asserting on the `gas/Spread` diag count
  (records every spread that EVER happened) instead.
- 🔵 Iteration snapshot is `List<Entity>` — one allocation per tick.
  Profile in G.12 if it shows up; for now the per-turn cost is
  acceptable (matches Zone.GetAllEntities convention).
- 🔵 `CreatorModifyGasDispersal` event surface exists but no Part
  consumes it yet (GasTumbler is G.7). Tested via a stub
  `GasDispersalRateDoubler` so the seam is verified.
- 🔵 `GasSpawned` event from §7 of plan — NOT yet emitted. Deferred
  to G.7 where it'd matter for grenade-detonate observability.
- 🧪 RED → GREEN cycle observed (33 tests, 3 RED, fixed, re-ran 33/33 GREEN).
- ⚪ Wind, phase, AI nav — deferred per plan §7.

all green.

### G.5 (this commit) — First behaving gas: Poison

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE. First gas type that actually does something
to creatures. The gas system is now player-visible: walking into a
poison-vapor cloud takes damage and applies a lingering effect.

**Architecture (Qud parity, IGasBehavior tree):**

```
Part (CoO base)
├── GasPoolPart                  (G.2 — universal state)
└── IGasBehaviorPart             (G.5 — abstract; BaseGas accessor)
    └── IObjectGasBehaviorPart   (G.5 — abstract; ApplyGas dispatch)
        └── GasPoisonPart        (G.5 — concrete; first behavior)
```

**Two dispatch paths (Qud parity):**
1. **On-entry** — `EntityEnteredCell` event fires on the gas entity
   (the same event LiquidPoolPart listens to). The Part calls
   `ApplyGas(entrant, zone)`. Mirrors Qud
   `IObjectGasBehavior.HandleEvent(ObjectEnteredCellEvent)`.
2. **Per-turn** — `GasSystem.OnTickEnd` extended with
   `DispatchPerTurnApply` — after each gas's dispersal, it calls the
   behavior Part's `ApplyToCell(cell, zone)` which iterates the cell's
   objects. Mirrors Qud `IObjectGasBehavior.TurnTick`.

**Filter pipeline (Qud parity, 5 gates in CoO):**
1. `target != self` (gas can't gas itself)
2. `target.Tags.ContainsKey("Creature")` — non-creatures get
   `gas/ApplyVetoed reason="NotACreature"`
3. `CheckGasCanAffect` event veto — fires on target, listeners
   (G.6 GasImmunityPart) return false from HandleEvent to veto. Emits
   `gas/ApplyVetoed reason="GasImmunity"`
4. `GetRespiratoryPerformance` event — fires on target, listeners
   (G.6 GasMaskPart) reduce "Intake" param. 0 intake = vetoed
   (`reason="ZeroIntake"`); otherwise scales immediate damage
5. Apply `PoisonedByGasEffect` (Duration random 1-10, DamagePerTurn =
   `GasLevel * 2`) + immediate damage = `ceil((intake+1)/20)` (floor 1)

**PoisonedByGasEffect (lingering tick):**
The gas's per-turn dose covers creatures STANDING IN the cloud; this
effect handles creatures who walked OUT. Qud parity: the effect's
`OnTurnStart` SUPPRESSES the tick when the target's current cell still
contains a matching-type gas (the cloud's own per-turn covers them).
Outside the cloud, the effect ticks `DamagePerTurn` until Duration
expires.

**Tests (20 total, all GREEN):**

*PART I — Factory wiring (3 tests):*
- BehaviorKind="Poison" attaches `GasPoisonPart` (accessible via
  abstract bases)
- Empty BehaviorKind → no behavior Part (visual-only gas)
- Unknown BehaviorKind → no crash, no Part, warning logged

*PART II — Filter chain (8 tests):*
- ApplyGas on Creature → immediate damage + effect applied
- ApplyGas on non-Creature → vetoed with `NotACreature` reason
- Self-target → no-op (gas can't gas itself)
- Null target → no crash
- TestGasImmunity stub for matching type → vetoed with `GasImmunity`
  reason; no damage, no effect
- Counter: immunity for different type doesn't block
- TestRespiratoryReducer (-90 intake) → effect still applies; damage
  hits the 1-floor
- Counter: full mask (-100 intake) → `ZeroIntake` veto; no effect

*PART III — Per-turn dispatch via GasSystem.OnTickEnd (2 tests):*
- Creature in gas cell → effect applied after one OnTickEnd
- Creature in different cell → no effect

*PART IV — PoisonedByGasEffect tick semantics (5 tests):*
- In matching-type gas cell → tick SUPPRESSED (no damage)
- Outside cloud → tick deals damage
- In DIFFERENT-type gas cell (cryo while gas-poisoned) → tick still
  fires (suppression matches by GasType, not "any gas")
- OnStack: larger Duration + larger DamagePerTurn win
- Counter: smaller incoming doesn't downgrade

*PART V — Diag observability (2 tests):*
- `gas/Applied` record fires with full payload
- `EntityEnteredCell` event triggers ApplyGas (on-entry dispatch pin)

**IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (risks verified before writing code)**
1. `Entity.FireEvent(GameEvent)` returns false when any Part's
   `HandleEvent` returns false (Entity.cs:255-265) — this is the veto
   semantics the filter chain depends on.
2. `Entity.FireEventAndRelease(GameEvent)` releases the event to the
   pool after firing — used for the `CheckGasCanAffect` veto query
   where I don't need post-fire param read.
3. For `GetRespiratoryPerformance` I use `FireEvent` then
   `e.GetParameter` then `e.Release()` — needed because I read params
   AFTER firing.
4. `StatusEffectsPart.RemoveEffect<PoisonedByGasEffect>()` before
   applying a new one — refreshes Duration (Qud parity), avoids
   tick-stacking on re-entry.
5. The Effect's `IsInMatchingGasCell` check uses
   `Zone.GetEntityPosition` + `GetCell.Objects` + GasType comparison.
   Resilient: null zone, null cell, missing GasPoolPart all handled.

**SCOPE DIVERGENCE FROM THE PLAN — none.**

**G.5 SELF-REVIEW (CLAUDE.md §5)**
- 🟡 (resolved) Respires tag — plan §3.6 noted opt-in `Respires` tag
  on creatures. Shipping with implicit-respires (any Creature) — G.5
  matches Qud's gates with one CoO-side adjustment: until robot/undead
  blueprints exist, every Creature respires. The opt-out path is to
  add a `NonRespires` tag in a future blueprint and add the gate to
  `CheckIsCreature` (one line in IObjectGasBehaviorPart).
- 🟡 (resolved) `PoisonedByGasEffect` separate from `PoisonedEffect`
  — intentional. The two have different damage credit (Owner = gas
  Creator vs tonic source), different stack semantics (max-wins vs
  duration-adds), and different cure paths (a future "anti-gas tonic"
  would target one but not the other).
- 🔵 RNG injection — `GasPoisonPart.TestRng` is a static for test
  determinism. Production uses `_defaultRng = new System.Random()`.
  Same shape as existing `PoisonedEffect.Rng`.
- 🔵 Per-turn dispatch fires AFTER dispersal in `OnTickEnd` — so a
  gas that dissipates this tick doesn't get a per-turn dose. Right
  call: a dissipating cloud is by definition too thin to deliver a
  meaningful dose.
- 🧪 RED → GREEN observed (test file authored, 20 tests, 20 GREEN
  first compile-pass — no real bugs surfaced this commit, mostly
  pin-as-correct invariants).
- ⚪ AI nav weight (G.11), GasMaskPart proper (G.6), GasImmunityPart
  proper (G.6) — out of scope, stubbed in tests so the event surface
  is verified.

**Tests:** 20 new GREEN. Full regression sweep (11 suites,
322 tests): all green. G.5 introduces a new event listener
(IObjectGasBehaviorPart on EntityEnteredCell) but it's gated to the
"EntityEnteredCell" event only, so no per-frame cost.

### G.6 (this commit) — Defenses: GasMaskPart + GasImmunityPart

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE. Promotes the test stubs from G.5
(`TestGasImmunity` / `TestRespiratoryReducer`) to production Parts.
The event surface was already wired and tested in G.5; G.6 is
essentially "make the stubs production-quality and add a single new
hook (BeforeTakeDamage gas-damage scaling) on GasMaskPart."

**Shipped:**

- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasMaskPart.cs` — Two gates in
  one Part:
  - `GetRespiratoryPerformance`: reduces "Intake" by `Power × 5`
    (Qud parity GasMask.cs:33). Defensive clamp to ≥ 0.
  - `BeforeTakeDamage`: if damage carries the "Gas" attribute,
    scales Amount by `(100 - Power) / 100` (Qud parity GasMask.cs:49).
    Non-gas damage is untouched.
  - Emits `gas/MaskIntakeReduced` and `gas/MaskDamageReduced` for
    observability.
- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasImmunityPart.cs` — Per-type
  veto:
  - Listens to `CheckGasCanAffect`. When event's `GasType` param
    matches the Part's `GasType` field, HandleEvent returns false →
    Entity.FireEvent returns false → filter pipeline vetoes.
  - Empty `GasType` field is the defensive "no match" path —
    explicitly NOT a blanket veto.
  - Multiple `GasImmunityPart` instances on one creature are
    independent (creature is immune to N types).
  - Emits `gas/ImmunityVeto`.
- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Materials/GasPoisonPart.cs` (modified):
  immediate exposure damage now carries BOTH "Poison" AND "Gas"
  attributes. The "Gas" tag is what `GasMaskPart`'s BeforeTakeDamage
  hook looks for; without it, the mask's damage-scaling gate never
  fires. (Lingering tick from `PoisonedByGasEffect` stays single-
  tagged with "Poison" only — the carry-after-exit isn't a fresh
  inhale, so the mask shouldn't help there.)
- `Assets/Tests/EditMode/Gameplay/Materials/GasDefensesTests.cs` —
  18 tests across 3 sections:
  - PART I — GasMaskPart unit tests (7 tests): intake reduction at
    Power 10/20/overflow, BeforeTakeDamage on gas vs non-gas,
    defensive clamps, diag emission
  - PART II — GasImmunityPart unit tests (5 tests): matching/different/
    empty GasType, multi-instance independence, diag emission
  - PART III — Integration (6 tests): masked wearer takes reduced
    damage but effect still applies; Power 20 fully immune via
    ZeroIntake; immunity vetoes the pipeline; counter (immune to
    different type still affected); order pin (immunity → mask, so
    the mask's intake diag NEVER fires when immunity vetoes first);
    side-by-side comparison (masked vs bare creature in the same gas)

**IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (risks verified before writing code)**
1. CoO's `Entity.FireEvent` returns false when any Part returns
   false — the same veto semantics G.5's CheckCanAffect helper
   already uses (Entity.cs:255-265). `GasImmunityPart` returns false
   from HandleEvent → FireEvent returns false → ApplyGas treats it
   as vetoed.
2. `Damage.AddAttribute("Gas")` is a List<string> append — the same
   pattern G.5's PoisonedByGasEffect uses for "Poison". No new
   attribute-flag bit needed (the existing alias system is for
   element bitmask collapsing, not for arbitrary tags like "Gas").
3. `BeforeTakeDamage` listener checks `damage.HasAttribute("Gas")` —
   List.Contains, case-sensitive. Matches Qud's
   `Damage.Attributes.Contains` pattern (GasMask.cs:50).
4. Integer-math damage scaling: `(100 - 10) / 100 * 100 = 90`,
   `(100 - 10) / 100 * 2 = 1` (truncation). The floor is real and
   intentional — Qud uses the same `Amount * (100 - Power) / 100`
   integer division.

**SCOPE DIVERGENCE FROM THE PLAN — none.**

**G.6 SELF-REVIEW (CLAUDE.md §5)**
- 🟡 (resolved) Order pin: I added a dedicated test
  (`GasMaskAndImmunity_BothPresent_ImmunityVetoesFirst`) that pins
  the order — immunity vetoes BEFORE mask intake-reduction can fire.
  This protects against a future filter-pipeline reorder accidentally
  burning the mask reduction on already-vetoed gas.
- 🟡 (resolved) Adding "Gas" attribute to GasPoisonPart's immediate
  damage was load-bearing — without it, the mask's damage-scaling
  gate never fires (just like LA followup's case-sensitivity bug,
  the gate-was-correct-but-no-data-reaches-it failure mode). Tested
  via the side-by-side integration test (`GasMaskWearer_TickFromGasCloud_
  DamageReduced`).
- 🔵 GasMaskPart lives on a creature, not on a wearable item Part
  yet. Equipment-time routing (mask item → wearer Part) is the next
  layer; the LightSourcePart pattern from LB.4 is the template.
- 🔵 No save/load test for the new Parts yet — both have only public
  fields (Power, GasType) so the reflection round-trip just works,
  but I haven't pinned it explicitly. Would be a 2-line addition for
  the adversarial sweep when G.12 lands.
- 🧪 RED → GREEN observed (18 tests, 18 GREEN first compile-pass —
  the event surface was already shaped correctly in G.5, so promoting
  the stubs was mechanical).
- ⚪ "Inhaled Gas" save-roll gate (Qud GasMask.cs:40-45) — CoO has
  no save-roll system yet; deferred.

**Tests:** 18 new GREEN. Full regression sweep (12 suites,
340 tests): all green.
